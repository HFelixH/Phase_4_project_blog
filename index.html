        <h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>

          <p>
            Finally made it to the final learning Phase of Academy Xi’s Software Engineering course… RAILS. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This project was the most time consuming and hardest to learn, and it didn’t help that I was already behind with my Rails module. 
            Upon finishing the module leading up to the project, I realised how much more there is to rails. 
            This project really made me get out of my comfort zone once again and explore the vast internet for answers to every part of my rails project like a true software engineer.

        <h3>The Planning…</h3>

          <p>
            Step one of the Rails project was indeed a very hard step… deciding and planning. 
            I was so lost in what I want to build for my Rails app, but everyone else in the class had the same issue which was reassuring. 
            After numerous ideas, including complexed ones, 
            I chose to go with an example app that was recommended in the Project instructions… a task management app.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before jumping into planning, I rewatched previous classes where we built a to-do list. 
            I figure it would be similar concept, but I later discovered how very wrong I was…
          </p>

          <p>
            First, I planned that my models for the app will be ‘Users’, ‘Project’ and ‘Task’, 
            long with all the model attributes and relationships. A Task management app should allow ‘Users’ to create a ‘Project’, 
            and create specific ‘Tasks’ for the project and be able to determine the status of the tasks, 
            whether it is in progress or completed. However, a project should be User specific, 
            allowing the User to make changes and their own projects. 
            With the help of generating a scaffold, 
            I had the perfect outline on what I needed to begin the project!
          </p>

        <h3>Tackling the project…</h3>
        
        <p>
          With time running out, I jumped into the project and began building the app from scratch. 
          With the Rails Guide open on one screen, I began programming and creating my models, views, controller and data migration, and BOOM!...
          I was immediately stuck… User authentication…
        </p>
      
      <quote>
      <h2>Why isn’t my authentication for a User working…”</h2>
      </quote>

      <p>
        We had experiences with creating a user before, but authenticating a user with a login and sign up… I was so lost! 
        I had gone through our new Rails module with Authenticating a User and the lab was a piece of cake. 
        I had implemented this in my app with a session and all, but to no avail, it didn’t work, and I was so confused why it didn’t work. 
        After numerous hours of getting help from my good friend Google and breaking my programming with possible solution codes, I was defeated. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I checked the project requirements, knowing I had already failed to provide an authentication for a user. 
        Fortunately, in failure came the answer… ‘Devise’. A word I seen everywhere when searching for authenticating a user. 
        Time to learn something new!
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my Project from scratch again and implemented ‘Devise’. 
        Using Devise was simple, install the gem and it comes with instructions, 
        along with help from Devise cheat sheet provided by the developer. 
        Applied the instructions and I had a working user authentication! 
        Next came writing the controller and preparing my views, and implemented links to make use of nested resources. 
        Finally booted my app to index page with ‘root to: projects#index’ with authentication of a user before the page loads. 
        After days of being lost in code and stressed from confusion, my app worked!
      </p>

        <h2>"Testing… testing… testing…”</h2>
      </quote>

      <p>
        As happy as I was, I celebrated too soon… there were complications in running ‘devise’… Creating ‘rspec’ rails testing was the final step. 
        However, testing with devise is different from what I had encountered in labs, 
        because it required authentication before any further actions can be performed. 
        Off I went again… back to my good friend Google. 
        Thank God for StackForums and hello to FactoryBot and Devise test gem.
      </p>

      
      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>
        Every project so far has gotten me out of my comfort zone and surf Google for answers. 
        There is so much more to learn that is outside of what a module can teach you in four weeks. 
        Good to know that the learning doesn’t stop here.
